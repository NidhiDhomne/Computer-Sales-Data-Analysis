Welcome to my Computer Sales Data Analysis project! In this GitHub repository, I've focused on analyzing computer sales data using MySQL. This project demonstrates my ability to handle large datasets and uncover valuable insights through SQL.

Here, you'll find a variety of SQL queries designed to address common sales data challenges. From summarizing sales performance and tracking trends to identifying top-selling products and analyzing customer purchasing behaviors, each query showcases practical solutions and best practices for effective data analysis.

Explore this repository to see how I approach and solve sales data problems. Whether you're looking to learn new SQL techniques or gain insights into sales data analysis, I hope you find this project informative and useful.

Feel free to dive in, experiment with the queries, and see how data analysis can reveal important business insights. Let's enhance our analytical skills together!
